# PI_Calculator

Hello! 

This is a visual tool to approximate the value of the number PI (3,1415...). 
It calculates PI by throwing random points onto a sqaure and circle, and with mathmatical formulas (that of course don't include PI as a variable) it approximates the values of PI. 
In addition to calculating it, it shows a simple Java Graphic animation to make the passages clearer.
